Toggle highlighting the current line and column.

This function is the 'easiest' to use if you want to manually
toggle the mode. The parallel function `xhair' defaults to
highlight until the next keypress. The parallel function
`xhair-flash' defaults to highlight for
`xhair-flash-interval' seconds.

This function, when called interactively with a prefix-ARG, if
ARG is a positive integer performs the equivalent of function
`xhair-flash'. For other values of ARG highlights until the
next keypress.

Non-interactively, this function turns highlighting on if ARG is
NIL or positive; otherwise turns it off. When
ONLY-UNTIL-NEXT-EVENT is non-nil, highlighting is turned off at
the next key event. Otherwise, if SECONDS is a number,
highlighting remains on for the maximum of one or SECONDS
seconds. If SECONDS is otherwise non-nil, highlighting remains on
for the maximum of one or variable `xhair-flash-interval'
seconds.

(autoload 'xhair-flash "xhair" "\
Highlight the current line and column briefly.
Defaults to `xhair-flash-interval' seconds or to a numeric
prefix arg SECONDS greater than one second.

(autoload 'xhair "xhair" "\
Toggle highlighting current position with xhairs.

This function is the 'easiest' to use if you only want
highlighting until the next keypress. The parallel function
`xhair-mode' defaults to highlight until manually toggled.
The parallel function `xhair-flash' defaults to highlight for
`xhair-flash-interval' seconds.

This function, with a non-nil prefix ARG, retains highlighting
until you manually toggle it off.
